# TODO

- [ ] --directory arg should be mandatory (or default to cwd?)
- [ ] --file-extensions should accept comma-separated values
- [ ] --file-extensions should default to something sane, like `png,jpg,jpeg,gif`
- [ ] get fade transitions working
- [ ] test the generation logic, or toss it.
- [x] support url params for transition time
